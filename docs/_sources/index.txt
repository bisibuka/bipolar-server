Overview
========

**Bipolar** is a feature toggle micro service, a bit similar to **django-gargoyle**,
but with a deep difference: while django-gargoyle is mostly a tool to switch features
state on Django-based projects, Bipolar is a micro service to be used remotely by any
language or framework, backend, frontend or mobile.

That turns Bipolar a better tool to use in micro-service based architectures,
specially when there more than one language and framework in the whole system and
different frontend approaches.
