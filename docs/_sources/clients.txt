Clients

Python Client
-------------

Still with poor documentation but well covered by tests and pretty simple for understanding.
Just take a look at the tests and you must be ok.

ember-features
--------------

This is not exactly a Bipolar client but it can be helpful to implement Feature Toggle in
EmberJS based applications. To connect **ember-features** with **Bipolar Server** you must
listen to a Pusher account via websocket and call **App.Features.update()**. Or you can
publish your own URL that requests permissons to Bipolar Server and your JavaScript requests
it via Ajax call.
