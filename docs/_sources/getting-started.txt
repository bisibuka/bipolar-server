First understanding
===================

**Bipolar** is a project that offers feature toggle pattern under a different perspective
to the existing options - it is **language-agnostic**, under a micro-service-oriented approach.

That means it doesn't matters if your project is written in Python, Ruby, Java or any other,
it doesn't mean if you have many different components using different frameworks, etc. all is
managed in one single point, the **Bipolar Server**.

   The other way around: **when you change** features and/or qualifiers and their
   respective permissions in Bipolar Server.
